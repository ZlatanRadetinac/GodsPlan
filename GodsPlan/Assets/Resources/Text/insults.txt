I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits

I am the kid with the motormouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout

This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch

Last year, niggas got hot ‘cause they told on me
I’m about to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me
